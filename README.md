<h3> Jeshawn's Website</h3>
<h5>Still Needs:</h5>
<ul>
  <li> Logo</li>
  <li> Text that comes on the website</li>
  <li> cosmetic changes (the 'x' button) </li>
  </ul>

To any dev looking to host the site live in their home or root ip (127.0.0.1) simply open the command line. 
Then cd into the directory where the PS file lives and run cmd npm run dev to deploy the live server on port 
3000 by default.
